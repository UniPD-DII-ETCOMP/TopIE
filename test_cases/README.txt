Directories "ext", and "mag" contains subdirectories with the geometrical data for the test cases

"mag" = magnetic media : design domain
"ext" = external current driven coils

To create a user test-case:

1) duplicate the folder "test1" within "mag" and "ext" folders, and rename it e.g., "user_test"
2) Change the source of mesh coordinates and vertices "data.mphtxt" generated by COMSOL within mag/user_test and ext/user_test
3) Run "MAIN_geometry_runme_from_comsol" for magnetic media and external current-driven coils to generate the ".mat" files with data
